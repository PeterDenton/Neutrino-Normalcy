This code makes fig. 1 in the paper as well as different combinations of &theta;<sub>23</sub>, sin<sup>2</sup>&theta;<sub>23</sub>, &delta;, and cos&delta;. It also includes the analytic approximations calculated in the paper which are very good approximations. It also draws the 1 and 2 &sigma; contours for 2 dof's from NuFIT4.1 for the normal mass ordering without SK data. Different NuFIT files can be swapped in by just changing the file name in `py/nufit.py`.
