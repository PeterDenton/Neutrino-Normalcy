This code makes fig. 1 in the paper as well as variations as a function of both &theta;<sub>23</sub>, sin<sup>2</sup>&theta;<sub>23</sub>, &delta;, and cos&delta;. It also draws the 1 and 2 &sigma; contours for 2 dof's from NuFIT4.1 for the normal mass ordering without SK data. Different NuFIT files can be swapped in by just changing the file name in `py/nufit.py`.

## Reference
If you use this code please reference **[arXiv:2003.04319](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04319)** as well as [NuFIT4.1](http://nu-fit.org) for the global fit.
